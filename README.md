# NewDocs Hugo Theme

NewDocs makes it easy to create & edit a Project or Documentation website with Hugo, and deploy with GitHub or Netlify.

## Currently in Pre-release Beta

The first stable release will be `v0.60.0`.

Before that use carefully since:

- Things may break between different versions

- Demo site may change between different versions

- Documentation may not be fully covered
